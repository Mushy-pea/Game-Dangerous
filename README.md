# Game :: Dangerous (a tribute to ZZT)

## A project update as of 01/01/2024

Rather than focussing on progress with the technical aspects of engine and map editor development 
this update will be more gaming themed.  I intend to start work on a campaign map pack in earnest in 
Q1 2024, using the new map development editor.  I'll present a synopsis for this below and explain 
how certain games have inspired me to take this direction.

## The Perils of Gem Mining

The Perils of Gem Mining will tell the story of Ben and Sarah, smiley characters from code page 437 
as in the classic ZZT now realised in beautiful 3D.  A normal day at the Corporation of Aerospace 
Unions' Mars mining facility turns into a nightmare as the true perils of gem mining become apparent.  
Play as either character and navigate their interconnected stories to find a path to survival, 
leveraging their different abilities to sometimes solve the same challenges in different ways.  
Development of the map pack and associated game assets will be hosted in a private repository until 
their official release, at which time they will be made public.

Some games that have inspired me to take this direction are as follows.

ZZT: This is the earliest game I know of that was released with a map editor and scripting language 
allowing end users to develop their own content.  Although it was a long time ago I came across this 
gem I feel like it has inspired me to build an engine with bundled editor myself.  I decided to 
include game play and thematic elements from ZZT as a tribute to this classic game.

Resident Evil series: I like horror themed games as a genre.  The reason I've mentioned this in 
particular is the approach that certain games in the series have taken to level design and allowing 
the player to experience the story from the perspective of two different characters.  The weird 
juxtaposition of terribly wooden cut scenes and suspense laden horror in the first game cracked me 
up as well.  I played it on a SEGA Saturn.

Myhouse.wad (the Doom mod): Jumping forward about 27 years we have a GZDoom compatible mod that 
(at the time of writing) I haven't yet finished, but have already concluded is a masterpiece of 
level design.  This game exemplifies one of my favourite level design concepts: the map itself is a 
distributed puzzle based on exploration and item collection.  When combined with some great horror 
elements and impressive technical use of GZDoom's capabilities, it's kept me well entertained so far.

Thanks everyone for your continued interest in the project.  Have as good a 2024 as you reasonably can.

Engine version: 1.0.0
