# Game :: Dangerous (a tribute to ZZT)

## A project update as of 25/06/2023

The map development server now functions consistently on Windows and Linux and provides the bare minimum API I believe 
will be necessary to meet the project goals.  Work will now largely turn to developing the client (to be hosted at 
Mushy-pea/Game-Dangerous-Client).  If design issues with the API emerge during this process the server can be modified 
in parallel to allow for the intended client side experience.

Engine version: 0.9.0

Server version: 1.0.5
