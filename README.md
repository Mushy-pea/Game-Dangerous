# Game :: Dangerous (a tribute to ZZT)

## A project update as of 02/04/2023

I've set myself a target that by the end of September this year I'll have started to create production map content 
using the map development editor.  For much of the seven and a half years over which I've been (on and off) working 
on this project, it's felt like there was still such a mountain of work to do that I didn't even try to estimate when 
this milestone would be reached.  At this stage there's an engine that it appears can viably run the kind of game I'd 
like to build and a substantial part of the editor that would make it feasible to build.  There are still question 
marks over what will happen when I try to implement the game design ideas in my head on this platform, including complex 
puzzles.

I suspect it'll turn into a battle of patience and attrition where I'm forced to squeeze every last ounce of 
capability out of the engine (and myself) to make something anyone might find remotely fun.  That sounds like great fun 
in itself though.

Edit (06/06/2023): As my main Windows development machine is currently down with a suspected power supply failure, I've 
failed over to my PopOS Linux box until a fix is found.  This has revealed that a little more work is needed to get the 
server to work on both platforms.
