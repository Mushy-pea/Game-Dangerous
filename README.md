# Game :: Dangerous (a tribute to ZZT)

## A project update as of 16/08/2020

I have created the new repository The-Perils-of-Gem-Mining to hold the map files and scripts for the content package
of the same name.  I intend to make periodic releases of the engine packaged with game assets, such that the in development
content can be tried out and understood by any interested parties.  Obviously, this comes with a spoiler alert :) .
