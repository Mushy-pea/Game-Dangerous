# Game :: Dangerous (a tribute to ZZT)

## A project update as of 21/04/2019

40 months and 100 commits into developing the Game :: Dangerous engine and there are now two stages left to complete
before the next release (code name: Episode 1).  I'm also 13 commits into the map editor development and the first
component (the C# implementation of the GPLC compiler) is now working.

## Engine development (to do list)

1.  Perform a multi platform and controls update.  This will involve replacing all WinAPI specific code with the GLUT framework, thereby hopefully making it possible to build
    the engine for at least Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.  Make the control keys reassignable.  Also, add a settings menu for changing
    controls and graphics settings.

2.  Implement file based game state saving.
