# Game :: Dangerous (a tribute to ZZT)

## A project update as of 18/02/2020

February 2020 marks roughly 50 months on the development timeline of Game :: Dangerous.  Many challenges
have been faced since late 2015 and the days of struggling to render a single blue triangle.  I'd like to
say thanks to anyone who's shown an interest in the project; it has helped me to keep climbing this
seemingly never ending learning curve.  There is now one major planned feature yet to be implemented (in game music) and
the engine code base has just grown beyond 3000 lines of Haskell (with about 4800 in total when the shaders
and development tool chain are included).  I never set a target for this but compactness through specialisation
for purpose is my intention.

Looking back with a self critical eye I feel I should have done a bit more learning and research before starting
this, which has led to heavy amounts of trial and error and reworking.  I'm also aware that to experienced
Haskell devs the code probably looks pretty unwieldy in places.  Having said that, it pretty much works
as intended and I've been able to continue adding features up to the desired level without it becoming a tangled
mess.

So, I can finally say with some confidence that I'm intending to start building the campaign map set proper some time
next month.  I can't commit to a timeline for completing this, but it at least now seems feasible that this bizarre
combination of functional programming and retro gaming may see open waters this year.  :)
