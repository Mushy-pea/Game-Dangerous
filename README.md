# Game :: Dangerous (a tribute to ZZT)

## A project update as of 26/08/2019

While only being a snap shot of progress, the second release of this project in June this year was successful in
generating some interest in the project from other developers.  So, thanks to anyone who's shown an interest on
Github or Youtube.  I am currently focussed on dubugging the non - player characters (NPCs), which have turned out to
be one of the hardest features to get working satisfactorily.  The new Preprocess_map development tool is part
of this work.

Once the creases in the existing NPC code have been ironed out the last (and coolest) feature
will be added.  Namely the throwing of fireballs that interact with the dynamic lighting, as well as roasting
the player like a Sunday lunch of course.  After that it will be on to the last two major engine features, 
in game music and file based game state saving.

The next step will be to attempt to build a decent size campaign mode map set, using a combination of Blender, MS Paint,
a text editor and a few prototype tools such as the model importer and GPLC compiler.  Wish me luck.
