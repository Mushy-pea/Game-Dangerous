# Game :: Dangerous (a tribute to ZZT)

##A project update as of 04/12/2019

Recent progress has mainly been in fixing problems in the non - player character (NPC) logic and adding support for
moving light sources and NPCs that can throw them.  There are a few video links below on this and previous updates.
Almost all the intended game logic features are now either stable or at testing stage.  I am now dividing time
between testing and adding the two remaining features, namely saving game progress to file and optional in game music.

I intend to put out release 3 by early 2020, which is to some extent what release 2 would have been if I hadn't rushed
as much.  There will be the test map from release 2 (with characters that work) and some additional map content to be
decided on.  From then on I'll hopefully be mainly working on campaign content (and probably more debugging :) ).
