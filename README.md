# Game :: Dangerous (a tribute to ZZT)

## A project update as of 07/08/2025 : Work under way on Gem Mining - a map set for Game :: Dangerous

With the engine feature frozen the only thing left to do is build a game to run on it, which turns 
out to be a rather complex and multifaceted task in itself.  Initially I'd planned to go through this 
process behind closed doors, to not risk spoiling the game for anyone who ends up playing it.  However, 
I've since realised that spoiling games has become normalised in the modern era and that I'd rather have 
a public repository for the map set.  Nothing will be overtly spoiled but people can choose to deep dive 
into the maps as they develop per commit if they wish.

Gem - Mining: https://github.com/Mushy-pea/Gem-Mining

There is currently a demo build of the engine for Windows on itch.io packaged with 
assets and maps: https://basicas-games.itch.io/game-dangerous

If you want to attempt building the project for Linux or Windows these are the best resources I can suggest.

1. Game-Dangerous/build.sh: may be helpful as a kind of instruction manual for either platform.
2. Game-Dangerous/config.txt: This will need to be adapted for your build a little.
3. The most up to date game assets can be aquired through the release on itch.io.  If you're building for 
   Linux the text files need to be converted from CRLF to LF.

Engine version: 1.3.3

Server version: 2.2.1
